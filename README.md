# Data Analysis and insights
### Overall Business Performance (KPI Dashboard)

The KPI analysis provides a high-level summary of business performance.

Insights:
-	The business generated strong total revenue and profit.
-	A profit margin of approximately 46.5% indicates efficient cost management.
-	Order volume and quantity sold reflect consistent customer demand.



### Product Category Performance

Product category analysis highlights differences in performance across categories.

Insights:
-	Technology is the most profitable category, generating the highest revenue and profit.
-	Office Supplies records the highest order quantity but lower profitability.
-	Furniture is the lowest-performing category across revenue, profit, and quantity.

This shows that high sales volume does not always equal high profitability.



### Sales Trend Analysis

Sales trends were analyzed across time to identify patterns and seasonality.

Insights:
-	Sales fluctuate across months and quarters, indicating seasonal demand patterns.
-	Certain years and quarters consistently outperform others.
-	Sales performance varies by day of the week, supporting operational planning.



### Product Performance Analysis (Top & Bottom Products)

Product-level analysis identifies revenue concentration.

Insights:
-	A small number of products contribute significantly to total revenue.
-	Bottom-performing products generate minimal revenue and may require review.
-	Revenue concentration highlights opportunities for focused marketing and inventory optimization.
